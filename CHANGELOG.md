# v0.3.0 (wip)
- (**BREAK**) changed `curAnim`, `width` and `height` by `sprite()` are changed to methods `curAnim()`, `width()` and `height()`
- (**BREAK**) removed `velY`, `curPlatform` and `maxVel` fields by `body()`
- fixed `dt()` surge on page visibility change (#20)
- pause audio when page is not visible
- added built in debug control with `init({ debug: true, })`
  - `` ` ``: toggle `showLog` (default on with `debug: true`)
  - `f1`: toggle `showArea`
  - `f2`: toggle `hoverInfo`
  - `f8`: toggle `pause()`
  - `f7`: decrease `timeScale`
  - `f9`: increase `timeScale`
  - `f10`: `stepFrame()`
- added on screen logging with `log()` and `error()`
- fixed `loadRoot()` sometimes doesn't work in async tasks

# v0.2.0 "Hear the Tremble"
- added `pause()`, `resume()`, `stop()`, `loop()`, `unloop()`, `volume()`, `detune()`, `speed()` methods to the handle returned by `play()`
- added `camShake()` for built in camera shake
- (**BREAK**) removed `aseSpriteSheet` conf field from `loadSprite(name, src, conf)`
- added `loadAseprite(name, imgSrc, jsonSrc)`
- added area component generation for `text()`
- added `noArea` to conf field of `sprite()`, `rect()` and `text()`, allowing to disable auto area component generation
- added a `quad` field to sprite comp creation config `sprite(id, { quad: quad(0, 0, 0.5, 0.5) })`
- fixed `resolve()` not working if the obj also has `solid`, so it does not check for itself (#8)
- `mousePos()` accepts a layer argument, which returns the mouse position affected by camera transform if that layer is not `camIgnore()`-ed
- fixed camera position getting calculated before completing every object's update (#14)
- fixed some cases `on("grounded", f)` called multiple times when moving on a smooth platform
- added `revery()` to iterate objects in reverse order
- added `readd()` to re-add an object to the scene without triggering events
- added `level.spawn()`

# v0.1.0 "Oh Hi Mark"
- (**BREAK**) changed default origin point to `"topleft"`, so if you want object origin point to be at center you'll need to manual `origin("center")`
- (**BREAK**) integrated `kit/physics` and `kit/level` to main lib
- (**BREAK**) makes `collides()` only run on first collision, not run every frame during the same collision
- (**BREAK**) `camPos()` by default focuses to center, so `camPos(player.pos)` puts player in the center of the screen
- (**BREAK**) renamed `kaboom.import()` to `kaboom.global()`
- added an arg field to `start(scene, ...)` to forward args to start scene
- added `camScale()`, `camRot()` and `camIgnore()`
- added `obj.overlaps()` by `area()`, and `overlaps()`
- added 3 ext fonts under `ext/fonts`
